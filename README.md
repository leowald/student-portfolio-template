## 🔍 Code Samples

Here are some key snippets of code I wrote as part of my tasks:

```javascript
// Sample: User login component (React)
function Login() {
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // login logic here
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* form fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

```python
# Sample: API endpoint for task creation (Node.js/Express)
app.post('/tasks', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const task = await Task.create(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(task);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```
